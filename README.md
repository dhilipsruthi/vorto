# In the pursuit of devising an optimal solution for a complex optimization problem, I have amalgamated the renowned Clarke-Wright algorithm with the sophisticated technique of Guided Ejection Search. This strategic combination leverages the strength of the Clarke-Wright algorithm to establish seed data, providing a foundational basis for subsequent optimization endeavors. Building upon this groundwork, the application of the Guided Ejection Search method serves to judiciously modify the existing dataset, culminating in an intricately refined solution.

# This innovative approach is inspired by the scholarly work titled "Large Neighbourhood Search with Adaptive guided Ejection Search for the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows."

# Provided more time i would like to explore branch and bound algorithm, since its has exponential complexity I didnt want to risk implementing it in this case. But I would love to compare it the current solution and determine futher optimization.
